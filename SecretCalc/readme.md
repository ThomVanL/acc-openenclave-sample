A snippet from my [blog post](https://thomasvanlaere.com/posts/2020/06/azure-confidential-computing/) on Azure Confidential Compute.

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt -y install dkms
wget https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx-dcap/1.4/linux/distro/ubuntuServer18.04/sgx_linux_x64_driver_1.21.bin -O sgx_linux_x64_driver.bin
chmod +x sgx_linux_x64_driver.bin
sudo ./sgx_linux_x64_driver.bin

sudo apt -y install clang-7 libssl-dev gdb libsgx-enclave-common libsgx-enclave-common-dev libprotobuf10 libsgx-dcap-ql libsgx-dcap-ql-dev az-dcap-client open-enclave
```

Open Enclave, v0.9.0 at the time of writing, requires CMake version 3.12 or higher so I installed it like so:

```sh
wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.17.2/cmake-3.17.2-Linux-x86_64.sh
chmod u+x cmake-3.17.2-Linux-x86_64.sh
sudo mkdir /opt/cmake
sudo sh cmake-3.17.2-Linux-x86_64.sh --prefix=/opt/cmake --skip-license

sudo ln -s /opt/cmake/bin/ccmake /usr/local/bin/ccmake
sudo ln -s /opt/cmake/bin/cmake /usr/local/bin/cmake
sudo ln -s /opt/cmake/bin/cpack /usr/local/bin/cpack
sudo ln -s /opt/cmake/bin/ctest /usr/local/bin/ctest
```

### VS Code setup
Visual Studio Code has quite a few wonderful extensions, one of them will allow us to use our SGX machine's capabilities as if we were using it as a local dev box! Open up your extensions in VS Code, search for "```ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack```" and go ahead and install it.

Once installed you can connect to your SGX virtual machine by opening the command palette (ctrl/âŒ˜-shift-P), typing "```Remote-SSH: Connect to Host```" and selecting "```+ Add new host```". You will be prompted to enter the SSH command, which you can retrieve from your Azure deployment output via the Azure Portal, it should be along the lines of "```ssh <username>@<public_ip>```". Once you have gotten confirmation that the host has been added, run "```Remote-SSH: Connect to Host```" once more and select the public IP from the list. A new VS Code window will pop up and ask you for your password. You should now be connected to your SXG VM.

We will still have to go through some additional ceremony to get everything working nicely. __Our remote environment__ currently does not have the required VS Code extensions installed, more specifically we need to install the following extensions:
- ms-vscode.cpptools (C/C++)
- twxs.cmake (Cmake)
- ms-vscode.cmake-tools (Cmake tools)
- webfreak.debug (Native Debug)
